# KOCheck
A reproducible Nextflow pipeline for validating genetic knockouts. KOCheck analyzes Illumina reads to confirm a gene deletion, detect correct resistance marker insertion, and identify ectopic integrations across the genome. Designed primarily for microbiological and fungal genetic workflows.
